    "Depending on the selection, you'll have to edit the top cell of each notebook where black formatter extension is activated for the notebook cells.\r\n",
    "You can change this later, but it is convenient to only develop with one type of an editor.\r\n",
    "Black is a code formatting tool used to unify code style regardless of who is writing it.\r\n",

    "    You may have to change the kernel your notebook interpreter is using to the one you just created.\r\n",
    "    This can be done drop down bar in top of the notebook editor.\r\n",

    "10. Configure your git user name and email adress (one of those added to your git account) if you haven't done it already:\r\n",
    "```\r\n",

    "git config --global user.email \"MY_NAME@example.com\"\r\n",

    "```\r\n",
    "git add .\r\n",
    "git commit -m \"Initial commit\"\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "12. Push (save changes to remote repository): `git push -u origin master`. You will be asked to log in with your SSH key and password, again.\r\n"

    "1. Install this template as basis of your new project (see above)\r\n",

    "2. Check out the notebooks, and play around a bit to see that your installation works (notebooks run smoothly) and you understand the template structure\r\n",
